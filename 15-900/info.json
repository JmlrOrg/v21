    "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning is the problem of propagating labels from a small number of labelled data points to a larger set of unlabelled data.  This paper is concerned with the consistency of optimization-based techniques for such problems, in the limit where the labels have small noise and the underlying unlabelled data is well clustered.  We study graph-based probit for binary classification,  and a natural generalization of this method to multi-class classification using one-hot encoding.  The resulting objective function to be optimized comprises the sum of a quadratic form defined through a rational function of the graph Laplacian, involving only the unlabelled data, and a fidelity term involving only the labelled data.  The consistency analysis sheds light on the choice of the rational function defining the optimization.",
