    "abstract": "Sum-of-norms clustering is a method for assigning  $n$ points in $\\mathbf{R}^d$  to $K$ clusters,  $1\\le K\\le n$, using convex optimization.  Recently, Panahi (2017) proved that sum-of-norms clustering is guaranteed to recover a mixture of Gaussians under the restriction that the number of samples is not too large.  The purpose of this note is to lift this restriction, that is, show that sum-of-norms clustering can recover a mixture of Gaussians even as the number of samples tends to infinity.  Our proof relies on an interesting characterization of clusters computed by sum-of-norms clustering that was developed inside a proof of the agglomeration conjecture by Chiquet et al. (2017).  Because we believe this theorem has independent interest, we restate and reprove the Chiquet et al. (2017) result herein.",
