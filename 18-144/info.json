    "abstract": "DESlib is an open-source python library providing the implementation of several dynamic selection techniques. The library is divided into three modules: (i) dcs, containing the implementation of dynamic classifier selection methods (DCS); (ii) des, containing the implementation of dynamic ensemble selection methods (DES); (iii) static, with the implementation of static ensemble techniques. The library is fully documented (documentation available online on Read the Docs), has a high test coverage (codecov.io) and is part of the scikit-learn-contrib supported projects. Documentation, code and examples can be found on its GitHub page: https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/DESlib.",
