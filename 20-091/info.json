    "abstract": "tslearn is a general-purpose Python machine learning library for time series that offers tools for pre-processing and feature extraction as well as dedicated models for clustering, classification and regression. It follows scikit-learn's Application Programming Interface for transformers and estimators, allowing the use of standard pipelines and model selection tools on top of tslearn objects. It is distributed under the BSD-2-Clause license, and its source code is available at https://github.com/tslearn-team/tslearn.",
