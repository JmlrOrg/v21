    "abstract": "The problem of accurately measuring the similarity between graphs is at the core of many applications in a variety of disciplines. Graph kernels have recently emerged as a promising approach to this problem. There are now many kernels, each focusing on different structural aspects of graphs. Here, we present GraKeL, a library that unifies several graph kernels into a common framework. The library is written in Python and adheres to the scikit-learn interface. It is simple to use and can be naturally combined with scikit-learn's modules to build a complete machine learning pipeline for tasks such as graph classification and clustering. The code is BSD licensed and is available at: https://github.com/ysig/GraKeL.",
